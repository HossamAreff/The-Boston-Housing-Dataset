# The-Boston-Housing-Dataset
analyzes and predicts housing prices in Boston using various machine learning models.

-Machine learning models the I applied to predict housing prices:

Linear Regression - MSE: 12.70, R2: 0.74
Ridge Regression - MSE: 12.18, R2: 0.75
Lasso Regression - MSE: 12.41, R2: 0.74
Evaluation Metrics
The models were evaluated using the following metrics:

Increasing polynomial features from 2 to 4 slightly impacted Lasso Regression model performance positivly:
Lasso Regression - MSE: 6.40, R2: 0.87
